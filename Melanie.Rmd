Some information about me...

- I am from the UK but have lived in Ithaca for 5.5 years

- I work in the Microbiology Dept. but think I am more of an evolutionary/microbial ecologist - I've worked on various things!

- In my spare time I love being outside and doing sports - kayaking, climbing, running, cycling, horse-riding... I'll try anything.
